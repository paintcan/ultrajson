i did this to try out ujson in ctypes, using (for me) the obvious and what is now clearly the inefficient approach. i did tests (you will have to take my word on it)

regular ujson - ~22 seconds
my ctypes ujson in cpython - ~49 seconds
my ctypes ujson in pypy - 560 seconds!!!

so, this experiment is a failure
